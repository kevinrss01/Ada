# What is it?

A small project that allows discussing with an artificial intelligence simulating a human.

## What is it really?

An application codded with ReactJS and nodeJs that communicates with the chatGPT API. I process the API answers to make them look as human as possible.

## Start the project locally

Make sure you have Node installed
- `Git clone` the project
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
